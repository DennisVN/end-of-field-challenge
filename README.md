## end-of-field-challenge
In solo mode, recreate 2/3 given images, using only CSS HTML & SASS. No framework allowed, RIP. 
Have a peep at https://thirsty-booth-3bf43f.netlify.app/

## Motivation
Figure out how far we are in applying our gathered knowledge regarding front-end languages CSS HTML and SASS. DISCLAIMER: i did NOT use SASS.
 
## Screenshots
below you find the screenshots of the index.html page, presenting the 2 created cards. Index layout seems silly and unnecessary, and you're right. Learning should be fun tho, amirite ?

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- [VS CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Features
This is a very basic exercise for most, no special features were used. If i applied any in the beginning; i've deleted them for simplicity reasons and bug fixing. 

## Code Example
I started out with grid layout but decided to go for simple DIV's, as these "cards" aren't functional and pure aestheticly. See structure sample below :

<div class="wrapper">

            <div class="row"> <!--bovenste rij-->
                <div class="col">
                    <h1>Forgot Password</h1>
                    <h3>Get started immediately with these attractive form pages.</h3>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row test"> <!--vak met email en field-->
                <div class="col">
                    <label for="email">Email Adress</label>
                    <input type="email" id="email" name="email">   
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="button"> <!--reset knop-->
                        <button type="button">Send Reset Link</button>
            </div>


        </div>

#### Anything else that seems useful
Don't understimate simplicity. Don't be affraid to delete your project if your stuck. Starting over again and simplifying my approach helped me completing before the deadline.
