## Features
This is a very basic exercise for most, no special features were used. If i applied any in the beginning; i've deleted them for simplicity reasons and bug fixing. 

## Code Example
I started out with grid layout but decided to go for simple DIV's, as these "cards" aren't functional and pure aestheticly. See structure sample below :

<div class="wrapper">

            <div class="row"> <!--bovenste rij-->
                <div class="col">
                    <h1>Forgot Password</h1>
                    <h3>Get started immediately with these attractive form pages.</h3>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row test"> <!--vak met email en field-->
                <div class="col">
                    <label for="email">Email Adress</label>
                    <input type="email" id="email" name="email">   
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="button"> <!--reset knop-->
                        <button type="button">Send Reset Link</button>
            </div>


        </div>

#### Anything else that seems useful
Don't understimate simplicity. Don't be affraid to delete your project if your stuck. Starting over again and simplifying my approach helped me completing before the deadline.
